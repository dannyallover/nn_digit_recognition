# Neural Network Handwritten Digit Recognition

Inspired by the [Deep Learning Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk) offered by 3 Blue1Brown, I sought to write the barebones of a neural network (rather than using an off the shelf library). I then developed a simple architecture that scored competitively on recognizing handwritten digits from the famous MNIST dataset.
